	abstract = {Particle energies and fluxes have predominantly been measured from instruments onboard satellites. In this study, we use daytime ground-based oxygen redline emission measurements, along with the ionospheric electron density, and electron temperature profiles measured from the incoherent scatter radar, and a physics-based modeling approach to derive the energy and flux of particles incident over Boston during the storm of 30 October 2003. We find that the characteristic energy and the associated flux vary between 0.07–5.7 keV and 0.5–130 mW m−2, respectively, during the intense magnetic disturbance that brought aurora to midlatitudes. Such an approach not only offers another method to estimate the incident particle energies and fluxes but also enhances our understanding on the channels of energy deposition in the upper atmospheric region, especially during magnetic disturbances, about which database is poor.},

	abstract = {The relationship between auroral electron fluxes and spectroscopic emission features in aurora is quantitatively explored. The model computations focus on the prominent auroral radiations of atomic oxygen at 6300 Å and 5577 Å and a vibrational band of ionized molecular nitrogen at 4278 Å. The emission rate ratios, 6300/4278, 5577/4278, and 6300/5577, together with the absolute emission rate of the 4278-Å radiation, may be used to infer a characteristic energy of the precipitating electron flux. This characteristic energy and the 4278-Å intensity then determine the total electron flux and the energy deposition rate. Computational results are presented in easily used curves, and the assumptions made in the model calculations are discussed in the text. At the present time it appears that the ratio 6300/4278 is the most reliable and informative of the set.},

The luminosity profiles for the N2+ 1 N.G. (0,0) band are predicted for various energy distributions of auroral primaries. Power laws and exponential laws with a range of exponents are investigated: the shape of the luminosity profile is highly sensitive to the energy distribution function adopted.

	abstract = {Abstract. 
We describe a high-throughput (5×10−4  cm2 sr) imaging spectrograph that uses an echelle grating operating at a high dispersion order (24 to 43) to observe extended sources such as atmospheric airglow and diffuse proton aurora at high spectral resolution (approximately 0.02 nm). Instead of using a traditional single slit, the implementation of the instrument described here uses four (50  μm×25  mm) slits through which the radiation enters the spectrograph. The field of view is selected using appropriate foreoptics: the present implementation is a long, narrow configuration of 0.1×50  deg. By placing interference filters in the beam path, the instrument can simultaneously observe several spectral features located anywhere in the visible band (approximately 300 to 1000 nm) at high resolution. This design allows a single echelle grating and a single detector (a CCD in the present implementation) to view the same scene. The design is flexible; the number of slits and the slit dimensions can be tailored to the trade-offs between resolution, throughput, and number of spectral features depending upon the measurement need. While the implementation described here covers only the visible range, the use of different combinations of detector and filter sets can extend its operation to other wavelength regions.},

	abstract = {A technique is presented for inverting incoherent scatter radar (ISR) measurements of the auroral ionosphere to determine the incident electron energy spectrum. A linear model is constructed relating electron differential number flux to the volume production rate of ions, the latter derived from measured electron density profiles using a continuity equation. The forward model is inverted using the maximum entropy method (MEM). This implementation of ISR inversion was found to be remarkably robust to the principal sources of model and measurement uncertainty. The procedure was applied to high-resolution measurements (1.2 s × 1 km) by the Sondrestrom ISR recorded during an auroral surge. Analysis of bulk plasma properties in the recovered spectra suggested that the relationship between the characteristic energy and the net number flux was highly nonlinear during the onset of the auroral surge, an observation that can now be evaluated statistically. This perspective on the temporal behavior of the auroral acceleration region cannot be accessed through spaceborne measurements; ISR inversion thus constitutes a critical tool for addressing time-dependent coupling of the magnetosphere and ionosphere.},

Emission altitude profiles are compared to the results from an electron transport and chemical reaction model. The model incorporates measurements of the energetic electron flux, neutral composition, ion composition, and electron density. Reasonable correspondence is obtained using primarily the “classical” sources of O(¹D) excitation: electron impact on atomic oxygen and dissociative recombination of O2+. The reaction of N(²D) with O2 is considered to be a minor source. Small contributions are also calculated for cascade from O(¹S), electron impact dissociation of O2, reaction of N+ with O2, and energy transfer from O+(²D) and thermal electrons to O(³P). A possible minor source from the quenching of N(²D) or N(²P) by O(³P) is also discussed.},

	abstract = {The Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) instrument carried aboard the NASA TIMED satellite measures the spectral radiance of the Earth's far ultraviolet airglow in the spectral region from 120 to 180 nm using a cross-track scanning spectrometer design. Continuous operation of the instrument provides images of the Earth's disk and limb in five selectable spectral bands. Also, spectra at fixed scanning mirror position can be obtained. Initial results demonstrate the quantitative functionality of the instrument for studies of the Earth's dayglow, aurora, and ionosphere. Moreover, through forward modeling, the abundance of the major constituents of the thermosphere, O, N2, and O2 and thermospheric temperatures can be retrieved from observations of the limb radiance. Variations of the column O/N2 ratio can be deduced from sunlit disk observations. In regions of auroral precipitation not only can the aurora regions be geographically located and the auroral boundaries identified, but also the energy flux Q, the characteristic energy Eo, and a parameter fo that scales the abundance of neutral atomic oxygen can be derived. Radiance due to radiative recombination in the ionospheric F region is evident from both dayside and nightside observations of the Earth's limb and disk, respectively. Regions of depleted F-region electron density are evident in the tropical Appleton anomaly regions, associated with so-called ionospheric “bubbles.” Access to the GUVI data is provided through the GUVI website www.timed.jhuapl.edu{\textbackslash}guvi.},

	abstract = {The new NRLMSISE-00 empirical atmospheric model extends from the ground to the exobase and is a major upgrade of the MSISE-90 model in the thermosphere. The new model and the associated NRLMSIS database now include the following data: (1) total mass density from satellite accelerometers and from orbit determination (including the Jacchia and Barlier data sets), (2) temperature from incoherent scatter radar covering 1981–1997, and (3) molecular oxygen number density, [O2], from solar ultraviolet occultation aboard the Solar Maximum Mission. A new component, “anomalous oxygen,” allows for appreciable O+ and hot atomic oxygen contributions to the total mass density at high altitudes and applies primarily to drag estimation above 500 km. Extensive tables compare our entire database to the NRLMSISE-00, MSISE-90, and Jacchia-70 models for different altitude bands and levels of geomagnetic activity. We also explore scientific issues related to the new data sets in the NRLMSIS database. Especially noteworthy is the solar activity dependence of the Jacchia data, with which we study a large O+ contribution to the total mass density under the combination of summer, low solar activity, high latitude, and high altitude. Under these conditions, except at very low solar activity, the Jacchia data and the Jacchia-70 model indeed show a significantly higher total mass density than does MSISE-90. However, under the corresponding winter conditions, the MSIS-class models represent a noticeable improvement relative to Jacchia-70 over a wide range of F10.7. Considering the two regimes together, NRLMSISE-00 achieves an improvement over both MSISE-90 and Jacchia-70 by incorporating advantages of each.},

A combination of two avalanche photodiodes and a large area solid-state detector (SSD) provided 46 total energy bins (1 keV resolution for 3-20 keV range for APDs, and 7 keV resolution for {\textgreater}20 keV range for SSDs). Multi-channel ultra-low power application-specific integrated circuits are also verified for the flight operation to read-out and analyze the detector signals. MESP was launched from Poker Flat Research Range on 3 March 2014 as a part of ground-to-rocket electrodynamics-electrons correlative experiment (GREECE) mission. MESP successfully measured the precipitating electrons from 3 to 120 keV in 120-ms time resolution and characterized the features of suprathermal distributions associated with auroral arcs throughout the flight. The measured electrons were showing the inverted-V type spectra, consistent with the past measurements.

	abstract = {Since 1987, an all-sky airglow imaging system has operated from a site at the Millstone Hill/Haystack Observatory in Westford, MA. During the {\textasciitilde}2.5 solar cycles from 1987 to 2014, many studies using all-sky images, in conjunction with incoherent scatter radar and satellite data, described subauroral, ionospheric disturbances observed during individual geomagnetic storms. The most prominent storm time optical feature from a subauroral site is a stable auroral red (SAR) arc. The standard use of a SAR arc's position is to locate the ionospheric footprint of the narrow plasmapause-ring current interaction region where heat conduction from the inner magnetosphere excites emission within the F layer trough. When mapped from an emission altitude of 400 km to the geomagnetic equatorial plane, SAR arcs from Millstone Hill give the location of the plasmapause at radial distances between 2 to 4.5 Earth radii. A total of 314 SAR arcs have been observed during the 27 years of imaging at Millstone Hill. We find no single morphology for all SAR arcs, but rather patterns that occasionally depart from stability in space and time. We have classified these into five categories: longevity, multiplicity, zonal structure, latitudinal inhomogeneity, and tilt with respect to geomagnetic coordinates. In each case, the implications for the inner magnetosphere sources that drive SAR arcs are explored. While individual SAR arc variability characteristics have been noted in previous studies, here we describe for the first time all five types from the same site—an aspect not yet addressed in either magnetosphere or ionosphere modeling studies.},

	abstract = {Two of the largest geomagnetic storms of the last decade were witnessed in 2015. On 17 March 2015, a coronal mass ejection-driven event occurred with a Dst (storm time ring current index) value reaching −223 nT. On 22 June 2015 another strong storm (Dst reaching −204 nT) was recorded. These two storms each produced almost total loss of radiation belt high-energy (E ≳ 1 MeV) electron fluxes. Following the dropouts of radiation belt fluxes there were complex and rather remarkable recoveries of the electrons extending up to nearly 10 MeV in kinetic energy. The energized outer zone electrons showed a rich variety of pitch angle features including strong “butterfly” distributions with deep minima in flux at α = 90°. However, despite strong driving of outer zone earthward radial diffusion in these storms, the previously reported “impenetrable barrier” at L ≈ 2.8 was pushed inward, but not significantly breached, and no E ≳ 2.0 MeV electrons were seen to pass through the radiation belt slot region to reach the inner Van Allen zone. Overall, these intense storms show a wealth of novel features of acceleration, transport, and loss that are demonstrated in the present detailed analysis.},

The models can capture the tendency of changes, especially under quiet or moderate geomagnetic conditions, but are less accurate under geomagnetic storms. The thermospheric density is sensitive to the EUV emission and geomagnetic activity, and double-peak structure appeared in the dayside. On 19 April dayside, TADs traveled toward the equator with phase speeds of the order of 300–750m/s, interfered near the equator to produce a total density perturbation of 25\%, and then passed through each other and into the opposite hemisphere. For ionospheric foF2, there are non-symmetric hemispheres’ features during the intense geomagnetic activities. In details, middle latitudes in the north and high latitudes in both hemispheres are negative ionospheric storms, and the maximum amplitudes of δfoF2 is about 60\%, but the amplitudes decrease from the higher to lower latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Meanwhile, the equatorial station shows positive phase, and the maximum value is about 100\%. Finally, the mechanisms for these features will be discussed in this study.},

	abstract = {The latest version of the International reference ionosphere, IRI2000 [Bilitza, 2001], contains a dependence on geomagnetic activity based on an empirical storm-time ionospheric correction model (STORM) [Araujo-Pradere et al., 2002]. The new storm correction in IRI is driven by the previous time history (33 hours) of ap and is designed to scale the normal quiet-time F layer critical frequency (foF2) to account for storm-time changes in the ionosphere. An extensive validation of IRI2000 has been performed during geomagnetic storm conditions to determine the validity of the new algorithms. The quality of the storm-time correction has been evaluated by comparing the model with the observed ionospheric response during all the geomagnetic storms with ap {\textgreater} 150 in 2000 and 2001, a total of 14 intervals. The model output was compared with the actual ionospheric response for all available ionosonde stations for each storm. The comparisons show that the model captures the decreases in electron density particularly well in summer and equinox conditions. To quantify the improvement in IRI2000, the root-mean-square error has been evaluated and compared with the previous version of IRI, which had no geomagnetic dependence. The results indicate that IRI2000 has almost a 30\% improvement over IRI95 during the storm days and is able to capture more than 50\% of the increase in variability, above quiet times, due to the storms.},

	abstract = {We present a method for reconstructing the precipitating electron flux from a set of multiwavelength digital all-sky auroral images. The method involves solving a large linear inversion problem, and it works for any number of all-sky imager stations and wavelengths. The idea in our method is to invert the energy-dependent precipitating electron flux directly and not the three-dimensional volume emission rate as an intermediate step. In this way, the inversion is automatically restricted to physical emission rate profiles. We show the effectiveness of the method in the all-sky camera case by simulated examples. The method is also applied to real data. The method is capable of correctly reconstructing not only auroral arc positions but also the precipitating electron energy and number fluxes, although not necessarily the full differential flux. A natural limitation is that arcs that are significantly off-zenith and are viewed sideways by only one all-sky camera station are smeared out. However, even for these arcs the average arc position and energy characteristics come out with reasonable accuracy.},

	abstract = {Composition and temperature data from satellite measurements and from radar backscatter observations show that dynamics is a major key in our understanding of the upper atmosphere. Individual gases are tracers of wind fields which in turn are driven by the energy and momentum sources of the complex magnetosphere-thermosphere-lower atmosphere system. As is shown with data from Ogo 6, ion drag effects on winds impose a magnetic field control on the thermospheric density structure. Differential heating manifests itself in day-night and summer-winter temperature contrasts and drives large-scale circulation that redistributes the minor gases to account for the observed winter bulges in O and He (a factor of 40 larger in winter than in summer) and the large phase separations between atmospheric species in the diurnal tide. Large-scale atomic oxygen transport within the thermosphere significantly enhances the annual temperature amplitude (by more than a factor of 2) and, through release of chemical energy, contributes to the mesospheric temperature anomaly. The latter phenomenon and the associated reversals in circulation are largely determined by the annual tide excited near 50 km and possibly by dissipation of gravity and planetary waves in the winter hemisphere. During magnetic storms, Joule heating and viscous dissipation drive winds that effectively deplete O and He in the auroral zones and accumulate them at lower latitudes. Mass transport of O amplifies and confines the temperature enhancement to high latitudes, compatible with the observed global response of mass density. The timing of wind and composition effects significantly contributes to the positive and negative phases in ionospheric storms. Owing to the rotational nature of ion drift momentum sources, their signatures in the atmosphere are comparatively weak and differ substantially from those associated with heat sources.},

The Ground-to-Rocket Electrodynamics-Electrons Correlative Experiment (GREECE) mission successfully launched from Poker Flat, Alaska, on 3 March 2014 at 11:09:50 UT and reached an apogee of approximately 335 km over the aurora. Multiple ground-based electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) imagers were positioned at Venetie, Alaska, and aimed toward magnetic zenith. The imagers observed the intensity of different auroral emission lines (427.8, 557.7, and 844.6 nm) at the magnetic foot point of the rocket payload. Emission line intensity data are correlated with electron characteristics measured by the GREECE onboard electron spectrometer. A modified version of the GLobal airglOW (GLOW) model is used to estimate precipitating electron characteristics based on optical emissions. GLOW predicted the electron population characteristics with 20\% error given the observed spectral intensities within 10° of magnetic zenith. Predictions are within 30\% of the actual values within 20° of magnetic zenith for inverted-V-type aurora. Therefore, it is argued that this technique can be used, at least in certain types of aurora, such as the inverted-V type presented here, to derive 2-D maps of electron characteristics. These can then be used to further derive 2-D maps of ionospheric parameters as a function of time, based solely on multispectral optical imaging data.},

The trade-off made in order to achieve high time resolution was to limit the aperture to only one look direction. The energy selection was done by using a permanent magnet to separate the incoming electrons, such that the different energies would fall onto different regions of the microchannel plate and therefore be detected by different anodes. A rectangular microchannel plate (MCP) was used (15 mm × 100 mm), and there was a total of 50 discrete anodes under the MCP, each one 15 mm × 1.5 mm, with a 0.5 mm spacing between anodes.

These models are commonly used to invert spectral auroral ground-based images to infer characteristics about incident electron populations when in situ measurements are unavailable. In this work, we examine and compare auroral emission intensities predicted by three commonly used electron transport models using varying electron population characteristics. We then compare model predictions to same-volume in situ electron measurements and ground-based imaging to qualitatively examine modeling prediction error. Initial comparisons showed differences in predictions by the GLobal airglOW (GLOW) model and the other transport models examined. Chemical reaction rates and radiative rates in GLOW were updated using recent publications, and predictions showed better agreement with the other models and the same-volume data, stressing that these rates are important to consider when modeling auroral processes. Predictions by each model exhibit similar behavior for varying atmospheric constants, energies, and energy fluxes. Same-volume electron data and images are highly correlated with predictions by each model, showing that these models can be used to accurately derive electron characteristics and ionospheric parameters based solely on multispectral optical imaging data.},

	abstract = {A population of protons with energy of some tens of keV, called the ring current, is found near the equatorial region of the magnetosphere at several earth radii. During the main phase of geomagnetic storms the ring current shifts toward lower L values into the region of the plasmapause, which is characterized by steep gradients in the plasma density. This interaction together with an anisotropic pitch angle distribution leads to ring current instability and the growth of ion cyclotron wave turbulence. As wave energy is dissipated in the ambient electron gas by Landau damping, the plasmapause electron temperature is raised to a few electron volts, and a substantial temperature gradient is created with respect to the ionosphere. The energy transferred to the ionosphere by pitch angle scattering in the low collision frequency region and by heat conduction in the collision-dominated regime raises the ionospheric electron temperature to several thousand degrees. Therefore an appreciable number of electrons in the high-energy tail of the Maxwellian distribution, i.e., electrons with energy greater than 2 eV, exist in the F region of the ionosphere at about 400 km, where atomic oxygen is the dominant neutral gas constituent. Two eV is the threshold for excitation of oxygen atoms to the metastable ¹D level, and these O(¹D) atoms emit 6300-Å radiation, the signature of stable auroral red (SAR) arcs. Although the energy input rate required to produce electron temperatures sufficient to cause average SAR arcs is less than 0.1 erg cm−2 s−1, the energy radiated in the red line is only about 0.003 erg cm−2 s−1. Thus an SAR arc is an optical manifestation of a slow release of energy from the magnetosphere during a geomagnetic storm. Energetically it is small in comparison with high-latitude auroral processes.},

The association of SAR arc dynamics with the development of asymmetric ring current (substorm injection) during the main phase of a storm is analyzed. It is shown how the pulsating precipitations of energetic ring current particles develop in the outer plasmasphere based on photometric observations.},

	abstract = {Since 1987, an all-sky airglow imaging system has operated from a site at the Millstone Hill/Haystack Observatory in Westford, MA. During the {\textasciitilde}2.5 solar cycles from 1987 to 2014, many studies using all-sky images, in conjunction with incoherent scatter radar and satellite data, described subauroral, ionospheric disturbances observed during individual geomagnetic storms. The most prominent storm time optical feature from a subauroral site is a stable auroral red (SAR) arc. The standard use of a SAR arc's position is to locate the ionospheric footprint of the narrow plasmapause-ring current interaction region where heat conduction from the inner magnetosphere excites emission within the F layer trough. When mapped from an emission altitude of 400 km to the geomagnetic equatorial plane, SAR arcs from Millstone Hill give the location of the plasmapause at radial distances between 2 to 4.5 Earth radii. A total of 314 SAR arcs have been observed during the 27 years of imaging at Millstone Hill. We find no single morphology for all SAR arcs, but rather patterns that occasionally depart from stability in space and time. We have classified these into five categories: longevity, multiplicity, zonal structure, latitudinal inhomogeneity, and tilt with respect to geomagnetic coordinates. In each case, the implications for the inner magnetosphere sources that drive SAR arcs are explored. While individual SAR arc variability characteristics have been noted in previous studies, here we describe for the first time all five types from the same site—an aspect not yet addressed in either magnetosphere or ionosphere modeling studies.},

	abstract = {Stable auroral red (SAR) arcs have been viewed across the midlatitude night sky with interest since their discovery in 1956. This relatively late discovery (compared to the poleward aurora) is a direct consequence of the subvisual levels of the delicate and diffuse light that makes up the SAR arc. Except in rare instances when the emissions actually crossover the threshold to visible levels, optical instruments are required to register their presence and document their morphology and occurrence frequency. SAR arcs are seen as relatively featureless, slowly changing bands of red light that can extend across the entire night sky. Early observations from the ground and from satellites established the relationship between SAR arcs and magnetic disturbances in near-Earth space involving the ring current (a population of high-energy ions trapped in the Earth's magnetic field). The long-lived, soft, red glow of SAR arcs reflects the slow energy loss from the ring current ions as they bounce back and forth in the Earth's confining field geometry, but the exact sequence of physical processes that feed a portion of the ring current energy to the SAR arc region is a matter of continuing debate. The midlatitude location of the SAR arc bands mirrors the high-altitude location of the outer portion of the ring current torus, but exactly how this positioning is related to gradients or enhancements in the high-altitude extension of the cold ionospheric plasma remained an open question. Our knowledge of SAR arcs and associated signatures now spans more than two full solar cycles. Detailed observations of the high-altitude space environment overlying the SAR arc region have been made, indicating that heavy ions from the lower atmosphere, energized by the solar wind interaction with the magnetosphere, play an important role in the SAR arc process. Sophisticated models of the coupled high- and low-altitude regions, involved in SAR arc formation, paint an interesting picture of the flow of energy between the atmosphere and near-Earth space. This energy flow culminates in the SAR arc's glowing red bands, which act, in turn, as sensitive markers of the interaction regions and processes. This emerging view of the SAR arc process and the new observational information that provided the underpinnings of its development from a rich framework of past theoretical and observational work is the subject of the present review.},

	abstract = {Monochromatic imaging instrumentation has been developed that uses narrow-band [12-Å full width at half maximum (FWHP)] interference filters or plane reflection gratings for 2-D imaging and imaging spectrograph applications. By changing the optics in front of the filter or grating, the field of view of the instruments can be varied from 180 deg (all sky) to 6 deg (narrow field). In the case of the 2-D monochromatic imager, the 12-mm-diam. filtered image is formed at {\textasciitilde}\textit{f}/1 on the input photocathode of an intensified CCD camera (380 x 488 pixels). Regardless of the field of view of the instrument, none of the rays passing through the filter exceeds 4.5 deg to the filter normal. In the spectrograph mode, a slit is placed on the field lens (at the focus of the objective lens) and the 4-in. interference filter is replaced with a reflection grating. The spectrum is imaged at \textit{f}/1 onto the previously described detector with the spatial dimension of 380 pixels and the wavelength dimension of 488 pixels. The sensitivities of the systems are approximately 50 to 100 rayleigh seconds (Rs) (SNR{\textasciitilde}2). Examples of data taken with both of these instruments include detection and mapping of Jupiter's sodium magnetonebula and stable auroral red (SAR) arcs in the terrestrial ionosphere.},
