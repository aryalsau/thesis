Complex processes in the upper-atmosphere of the Earth give rise to optical emissions in the form of airglow and aurora. Thus, these emissions are key diagnostics to study the processes involved in the upper-atmosphere. Simultaneous observations of these emissions allows one to (a) determine the characteristics of the precipitating particles that produced the aurora, (b) infer changes in the upper atmosphere and the photochemical processes leading to these emissions. A versatile new ground-based spectrograph known as High-Throughput and Multislit Imaging Spectrograph (HiT\&MIS) has been developed to observe airglow and auroral emissions simultaneously at six selected wavelengths on a round-the-clock basis. The selected spectral features are: HI 656.3 nm, HI 486.1 nm, OI 557.7 nm, OI 630.0 nm, OI 777.4 nm and $N_2$$^+$ 427.8 nm. The brightnesses of these emission features change simultaneously but differently depending on the energy of the precipitating electrons, the density structure of the atmospheric constituents producing these emissions and the mechanisms of how particular emissions are produced. Hence, these simultaneous measurements can be utilized to infer the energy characteristics of the precipitating electrons. For the current dissertation, (i) the characteristic energy and energy flux of energetic electron precipitation were inferred based on simultaneous measurements of OI 557.7 nm, OI 630.0 nm and $N_2$$^+$ 427.8 nm emission features during an auroral events. Measurement of these optical emissions were modeled based on an electron transport and chemical reaction model, in terms of atmospheric composition, geophysical parameters and the energy and energy flux of the precipitating particles.The method presented in this dissertation provides a way multispectral imagers can be used as a stand-alone tool to derive energy and energy flux during auroral events. In addition, (ii) because each airglow emission occurs at a particular altitude, round-the-clock measurement of multiple airglow emission features will be used to trace changes in the upper atmosphere at different altitudes. The proposed study will allow us to observe the solar-terrestrial interactions from the ground at high temporal resolution during both geomagnetically quiet and active times.
