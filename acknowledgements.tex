Acknowledge those who helped you. I offer no comment on proper degree of mushiness. The work in this thesis was only possible because of all the helpful and guiding members of the UMass Lowell engineering education community. Many people have helped me not just in research effort, but in introducing me to new thoughts and ideas that became foundational to this project.
