LaTeX Thesis Template for UMass Lowell

Builds cleanly using TeXShop on MacOS X. Easily works in any reasonable LaTeX environment.

1. Run BibTeX first. It will parse the bibliography file, 'bibliography.bib' into a form usable by Latex.

2. Run LaTeX on 'main.tex' All other files are included in main. 

3. The Preface is not required. I invented that myself. It is commented out in 'main.tex'. If you would like to use the preface, simply uncomment it and edit the 'preface.txt' file.

Thanks to all the past stewards of this toolchain, for all of the major and incremental improvements you have made. 

The current rules for dissertation formatting which this template is intended to implement can (probably) be found here:

Last updated November 2016 to satisfy the latest [(Spring 2012) thesis requirements](https://www.uml.edu/registrar/docs/thesis_guide.pdf).
