\chapter{Author Biography}

As of 2012, UMass Lowell calls for a ``Biographical Sketch of Author.''

The required brief biographical sketch should include the names of schools attended, the exact designation of diplomas and degrees awarded, the title and nature of any post-collegiate employment, together with the name and location of the employing organization, and a description of any previous graduate study or related research, publications, or special professional interests.
